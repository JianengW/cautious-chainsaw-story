Lucky is a Husky dog and lives with a rich family, Smith family, in New York.
He is 3 years old and was born in New York. He is gift from Mr. Green to celebrate
the birth of Emma in the Smiths. 

Lucky has a white and gray hair and his length is about 20ft.

Ever since Lucky was given to the Smith family, he has been eagerly awaiting till Emma is old enough to play. It passed
5 years since Emma was born. She could now walk and almost even talk, and most importantly play with Lucky. They could
run around the Smith family's yard together, she could throw balls to him. Lucky loved Emma and Emma was lucky to have Lucky.

Three years later, at the age of 8, Emma becomes a beautiful little girl. One night
she was sleeping, Emma started barking even without stop. Emma and her parents 
went downstairs to check what happened. As they walked into the garden, an earthquake
happened.

Emma loses consciousness. The next time she opened her eyes, the world looked different.
Not just because of the earthquake, but also because the colors she sees are not the
colors she is used to. Not only that, she FELT different. She looks down and realizes she is
walking on all fours; she has become Lucky. The earthquake earlier was the result of a
a dimensional rift that also transferred Emma's consciousness into the body of her fluffy friend.
This is why Emma barked when the earthquake happened, as the transfer was already in progress.
Since that fateful day, Emma embarked on a journey to understand the crumbling dimensions, in the
hopes of restoring her body.

Emma becomes a volunteer when she gets recovered from the earthquake. She tries to teach people what they should do while earthquake takes place.
